# Carleton University - Bootcamp

## Module 02 - Personal Profile

An even-numbered week challenge, therefore we need to start a template from scratch! Our task for this week challenge is to build a **Personal Profile Application** in where we present ourselves, as well as our skills in Web Developing, offer a way of contacting us and download of our resume. This profile will be refactored many times until we complete our course, this will hopefully be used to launch our new careers in web-developing

## Understanding requirements
Build a website in where potential employers can have a taste of what we can do, using this **Personal Profile** as a sample of a **Web Application**. The website should offer the most common techniques used in the market. For now, we have been asked to apply what we have learned so far.

The website has been designed in differente sections which are based on a wireframe designed to hold each of these sections. I have used several wireframes in order to keep the flow in the application. For example the about page was based on the following wireframe:

## Hero Website Portal
The portal section shows just a splash screen as form of presentation with a slogan. This portal gives space to the user to select the options from the navigation bar. The navigation bar present with the followin options:

<ul>
<li><strong>Home</strong> - This will return to the hero page ( application portal).</li>
<li><strong>About me</strong> - Presents user with About me information.</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong> - Includes the latest contract a few other ones.</li>
<li><strong>Contact me</strong> - Allows user to create a form to be used to contact me.</li>
<li><strong>Resume</strong> - Allows user to download (pdf) resume.</li>
</ul>

## About Us
In this section I present myself share with the reader information related to my career. What I am capable of doing and some of the tools that I have used in the past.

## Contact Me Page
The contact me page gives the user the option send me a message. The process should (not for this assignment) send an email through the system. I am using a <form> tag element to declare the form.

## Updating GitHub Repository
I have created several issues to track down my tasks. Closing them frequently once done. I have been pushing updates with its corresponding message. Only working versions have been pushed. No branches have been used in this assigment.

The commands I have been using are as follow:

<ul>
<li><strong>git add -A</strong> - Include comments related to changes. Includes all changes</li>
<li><strong>git commit -m [Message]</strong> - commit changes and update log</li>
<li><strong>git push -u origin main</strong> - pushes change unto repo</li>
<li><strong>git pull origin main</strong> - Download changes and directly merge/integrate new code</li>
<li><strong>git status</strong> - Displays changed files in your working directory</li>
</ul>

## Delivering Our Assignment
The last -but not the least, task in our assignment was to upload and post our assignment. As developers we will have to implement our systems -websites or other applications, in different environments; **Developing**, **QA Testing** and **Production**. 

It is important that we spend time understanding the procedures and business parameters or rules, when deploying a ready-for-testing-product or production-version.
